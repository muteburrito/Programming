import math
# We have multiple functions to work with numbers
x = 2.9
print(round(x))  # functions rounds off the the number
# We also have a module in python to return the absolute which means it will turn the number in positive.
print(abs(-34))
# Technically we have math module which we need to include everytime we want to use heavy math functions
# We need to import it in the begining of the code on the top
# And we can access it by pressing math.
